# <a href="#introduction" id="introduction" class="headerlink"></a> Introduction

Hyperion is a lightweight specification for RESTful JSON APIs.  It endeavors to provide guidance and convention for the variety of decisions API-writers need to make during their development.  Hyperion also takes some inspiration from [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld) as a nod to [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS), but with emphasis on low-overhead to make it easier for API-writers to adopt.

# <a href="#conformance" id="conformance" class="headerlink"></a> Conformance

The keywords may, must, must not, recommended, should, and should not are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)].

# <a href="#conventions" id="conventions" class="headerlink"></a> Conventions

## <a href="#conventions-content-negotiation" id="conventions-content-negotiation" class="headerlink"></a> Content Negotiation

Clients **MUST** send all JSON data in request documents with the header
`Content-Type: application/json`.

Servers **MUST** send all JSON data in response documents with the header
`Content-Type: application/json`.

## <a href="#conventions-uri" id="conventions-uri" class="headerlink"></a> URI

Anywhere a **URI** is specified, it must adhere to the following rules:

* **MUST** be a valid URI that is active and responds to requests.
* **MAY** contain all query string parameters used to retrieve that resource.
* **MUST** be relative path as it's sometimes difficult for servers to construct an absolute path reliably.
* **MUST** use `-` or hyphen as delimiter for words within the path.
* **MUST** use `snake_case` for query string parameters.
* **SHOULD** use lowercase characters for words within the path basename (up to the last occurrence of '/').  This is to account for various-case `id`s, such as those found in URL shorteners. E.g. `https://goo.gl/VwUrzz`

### <a href="#conventions-sub-service" id="urls" class="headerlink"></a> Sub-service Path

APIs **MUST** provide a sub-service path in the URI as a way to create a namespace for your endpoints.

A `sub-service` URI path **MUST** have the following:

* First path after the host following [URI](#conventions-uri) conventions. `https://api.company.com/`**`sub-service`**`/`
* Provide support for [versioning](#conventions-versioning). `https://api.company.com/`**`sub-service`**`/v`**`Major[.Minor]`**`/`

These two rules promote clear differentiation of sub-services and versions, allowing independent development.

### <a href="#conventions-http-status-codes" id="conventions-http-status-codes" class="headerlink"></a> HTTP Status Codes

APIs **MUST** respond to requests with an Http Status Code that is found in the following list:

status code | description | [error code](#document-components-error-codes) | notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
200 | OK | | The request has successfully completed processing
201 | Created | | Resource has been created and processed successfully
202 | Accepted | | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
204 | No content | | (for deletions only) The deletion process has completed
301 | Moved Permanently | Redirect requests permanently, and allow for changing method
303 | See Other | Redirect requests temporarily, and allow for changing method
304 | Not Modified | Implicit redirection to client's cache
307 | Temporary Redirect | Redirect requests temporarily, and do not allow changing method
308 | Permanent Redirect | Redirect requests permanently, and do not allow changing method
400 | Bad Request | invalid_input | The request has one or more errors and cannot be processed
401 | Unauthorized | unauthorized | The request did not include a required authentication component
403 | Forbidden | forbidden | The request has failed authorization checks
404 | Not found | not_found | Resource not found
405 | Method not allowed | method_not_allowed | The http method was not valid at the specified URI
409 | Conflict | invalid_operation | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource
413 | Payload Too Large | payload_too_large | Request payload is too large and the server will not process it
422 | Unprocessable Entity | The request and it's body are valid and parseable, but are malformed in a semantic way (missing data, incorrect structure)
429 | Too many Requests | rate_limit_reached | Too many requests have been received in a given amount of time
500 | Internal server error | internal_error | The server cannot process the request for an unknown reason
502 | Bad gateway | bad_gateway | The gateway server or proxy received an invalid response from upstream server while fulfilling a request
503 | Service Unavailable | service_unavailable | The server is currently unable to handle requests temporarily due to maintenance or resource exhaustion from high load
504 | Gateway timeout | gateway_timeout | The gateway server or proxy failed to receive a response from upstream server while fulfilling a request


### <a href="#conventions-versioning" id="urls" class="headerlink"></a> Versioning 

APIs **MUST** provide versioning in the URI path, following the sub-service path.

**MUST** increase either `Major` or `Minor` in the version path whenever a breaking change is introduced. `/vMajor[.Minor]`
    
* **SHOULD NOT** increase version if adding new endpoints or fields.

* **SHOULD** increase version if changing behavior for an existing API endpoint:

    * Such as modifying the HTTP status code
    * Changing data format
    * Changing the resource, ie. removing or renaming fields
    * Anything that would violate the [Principal of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)


`https://api.company.com/sub-service/v1`

`https://api.company.com/sub-service/v1.1`

## <a href="#conventions-casing" id="conventions-casing" class="headerlink"></a> Naming Conventions

* **MUST** use `PascalCase` and be singular to represent a `@type`.
* **MUST** use `snake_case` to represent a property.
* **MUST NOT** use `@` keyword for custom properties as it is reserved.


## <a href="#date" id="date" class="headerlink"></a> Date Handling

All dates **MUST** be represented as string values following the [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) standard.

All dates **MUST** follow [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) standard of `YYYY-MM-DD`.

An example of _date_ only value.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth",
    "date_of_birth": "1975-11-30"
}
```

All datetime **MUST** be `UTC` following the [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) standard of `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ`.

> Note: The `Z` designator at the end is what expresses a datetime as UTC. It will be treated as local datetime without it.

An example of UTC _datetime_ value.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth",
    "date_of_birth": "1975-11-30",
    "created_at": "2017-11-30T21:43:25Z"
}
```

## <a href="#time-series" id="time-series" class="headerlink"></a> Time Series

APIs that need to implement time series functionality **MUST** refer to specifications defined in the [time series]({{site.url}}/versions/{{site.latest_version}}/time-series) section.

An example of _time series_ using relative time.

`https://api.vdms.io/analytics/v1/time-series?start=now-1M&end=now`

```json
{
    "@id": "/analytics/v1/time-series?start=now-1M&end=now",
    "@type": "TimeSeries",
    "start": "2018-05-18T21:43:25Z",
    "end": "2018-06-18T21:43:25Z",
    ...
}
```


# <a href="#keywords" id="keywords" class="headerlink"></a> Keywords

Hyperion specifies a few keywords as part of the core specification:

* `@id`: Used to specify the [URI](#conventions-uri) for the resource. Can be used by clients to navigate back to that specific resource. This **SHOULD NOT** be confused as the identifier for the instance of that resource.

    Example of the difference between `@id` and a similar property like `id`:

```json
{
    "@id": "/connect/userinfo/1",
    "@type": "UserInfo",
    "id": 1,
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth"
}
```

* `@type`: Used to set the type of the [node](#document-components-node). This **MUST** be a string value following the [naming conventions](#conventions-casing).
* `@links`: Used to represent a collection of [link value](#document-components-link-value) related to the resource.


> Note: To avoid compatibility issues, properties starting with an `@` character are restricted as they might be used as keywords in future versions of JSON-LD. Properties starting with an `@` character that are not JSON-LD keywords are treated as any other property, i.e., they are ignored. Keywords are case-sensitive.
>
> Restricted keywords are: `@context`, `@id`, `@value`, `@language`, `@type`, `@container`, `@list`, `@set`, `@reverse`, `@index`, `@base`, `@vocab`, `@graph`, `@nest`, `@prefix`, `@version`, `@links`


# <a href="#document" id="document" class="headerlink"></a> Document Structure

All requests sent by the client and responses sent by the server **MUST** be a valid JSON document.

```json
{
    ...
}
```

All JSON properties **MUST** follow [naming conventions](#conventions-casing).

```json
{
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth"
}
```

The _top most_ JSON object **MUST** be a [node](#document-components-node) and **MUST** contain an `@id` property unless _creating_ a new resource.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    ...
}
```

An example of a node with query string parameters:

```json
{
    "@id": "/users?page=1",
    ...
}
```

The top most JSON object **MUST** be a [node](#document-components-node) and **MUST** contain a `@type` property.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth"
}
```


## <a href="#document-components-node" id="document-components-node" class="headerlink"></a> Node

A `Node` represents a JSON object. A `Node` **MUST** contain the `@id` property if it is the top most object. It **SHOULD NOT** be in the JSON object when _creating_ a resource.

The `@id` property represents a valid [URI](#conventions-uri) and follows conventions described in the [keywords section](#keywords).

A `Node` **MUST** contain the `@type` keyword.

The value for `@type` property **MUST** be a string value representing the type following [naming conventions](#conventions-casing).

An example of `@type`:

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    ...
}
```

A node **MAY** contain nested nodes.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth",
    "address" : {
        "@id": "/users/1/address",
        "@type": "Address",
        "street": "West 57th Street"
    }
}
```

A node **MAY** contain [links](#document-components-link-collection) with the keyword of `@links`.

```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "@links" : {
        "users": {
            "href": "/users"
        }
    },
    "given_name": "Hubert",
    "family_name": "Farnsworth"
}
```

### <a href="#document-components-link" id="document-components-link" class="headerlink"></a> Link

A `Link` is an object used to represent a collection of [link value](#document-components-link-value) related to the resource.

A `Link` **MUST** have the following:

* Nested within a [node](#document-components-node) with a keyword of `@links`.

* Must contain [link value](#document-components-link-value).

### <a href="#document-components-link-value" id="document-components-link-value" class="headerlink"></a> Link Value

A `LinkValue` is an object containing a valid URI.

A `LinkValue` **MUST** have the property `href` which represents a valid [URI](#conventions-uri).

A `LinkValue` **MAY** have the following:

* `base_path` which represents a path that can be prepended to the `href` value. The value is defined by `scheme`, `host` and optionally a `path`. It **MUST NOT** end with a slash.

* `description` which will provide additional information for each link.


```json
{
    "@id": "/users/1",
    "@type": "User",
    "@links" : {
        "users": {
            "href": "/users",

}
```


## <a href="#document-components-error" id="document-components-error" class="headerlink"></a> Error

Processing errors can be handled by returning a [node](#document-components-node) of `Error` to consumers. In addition, an appropriate HTTP status code, a human readable [error code](#document-components-error-codes) must be returned.

An `Error` **MUST** have the following:

An `ErrorDetail` **MUST** have the following:

* `@type`: Have a value of `ErrorDetail`.
* `description`: Detail description about the error as string.

An `ErrorDetail` **MAY** have the following:
